The other day I was super bored so I decided "You know what? Fuck it I'm making something stupid."

This is the result of said stupid thing

I made a small dumb program that prints the entirety of Bad Apple inside of a CMD window.

Here's the download link:

[EXECUTABLE](https://cdn-sereno.pages.dev/files/badapple-ascii/print.exe)

A link to the [code](https://cdn-sereno.pages.dev/files/code/printbadapple.txt) in case you want to see it.

It requires [.NET 6 or newer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) to run.

It automatically downloads all the necessary ASCII files, then deletes them once its done playing.

Here's a demo of it.
